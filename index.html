  <h1> Bohemian Rhapsody</h1>
   <h2>Queen</h2>
   <p>Is this the real life? 
      Is this just fantasy? 
      Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality. 
      Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see. 
      I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, 
      Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low.
      Anyway the wind blows 
      Doesn't really matter to me, to me.
