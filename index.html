  <h1> Bohemian Rhapsody</h1>
   <h2>Queen</h2>
   <p>Is this the real life? 
      Is this just fantasy? 
      Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality. 
      Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see. 
      I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, 
      Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low.
      Anyway the wind blows 
      Doesn't really matter to me, to me. 
   </p>
  <p>Mama just killed a man
    Put a gun against his head 
    Pulled my trigger, now he's dead. 
    Mama, life had just begun
    But now I've gone and thrown it all away. 
    Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry, 
    If I'm not back again this time tomorrow, 
    Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters.
